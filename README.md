# AI-based-Latency-Optimization-in-ORAN-for-IoT-Sensor-Networks - IEEE SENSORS 2025 
# Work in Progress !

While the introduction of state-of-the-art ORAN
systems has granted internet service providers the flexibility
of disintegrating the Radio Unit, Control Unit and Distributed
Unit, it adds latency in signal propagation and limits network
performance. We have studied how placing different ORAN units
in different locations can increase the communication delay of
the systems using various sensors and IoT applications. There
is a need for latency optimization in ORAN systems using IoT
sensors. In this paper, we propose a system that uses Artificial
Intelligence (AI) that can play a critical role in optimizing the
latency in ORAN communications using IoT sensors. We used
a Deep Reinforcement Learning process in AI to improve the
additional latency introduced by placing the RU, CU, DU of
ORAN in multiple data centers. Our prototype for this model
uses data from temperature sensors to be transmitted over the
network, the RU, CU and DU of which are built using sensor-
initiated IoT microcontrollers. The results show that using AI,
the latency of signal propagation in ORAN is improved by upto
32.5%
